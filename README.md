Heavy Burdens: Exploring the Link Between Income and Obesity 
This is my first data analysis project. It explores how income levels and obesity rates correlate across U.S. states, using 2015 data. The goal was to visualize whether there’s a connection between lower income and higher obesity rates.
Motivation
I chose this topic because I grew up in a low-income household in one of the five lowest-income states in the U.S. I’ve seen firsthand how difficult it is to afford fresh, healthy food — even when you want to. Heavily processed foods are often the only viable option due to their low cost and longer shelf life. I’ve always wondered: is there a clear connection between income and obesity in the U.S.?
Sources
⦁	Income Data: U.S. Census Bureau
⦁	Cleaned and filtered to use only the year 2015, to align with the obesity dataset.
⦁	Obesity Data: Data.gov (Lake County, Illinois)
⦁	Due to issues finding sufficent data, this initially only consisted of 2015. Data was cleaned for efficency. 
Tools Used: 
⦁	Python
⦁	Pandas
⦁	matplotb/seaborn
              Key Takeaways:
⦁	Colorado has the lowest obesity rate (~20%) and is the 8th highest-income state.
⦁	Louisiana has the highest obesity rate (>36%) and is 6th lowest in income.
⦁	A general trend appears: lower-income states tend to have higher obesity rates, suggesting a socioeconomic link to health outcomes.
